# IMPROVEMENTS

1. __Most calls to `read.csv` and `write.csv` might be handled through the [`readr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/) package__, in order to speed up input/output during code execution. It might be safer to wait for the `readr` package to mature enough to make sure that this will not break some variables, such as dates.
* __Most calls to the `XML` package might be handled through (or rewritten for) the [`rvest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/) package__, in order to make the code easier to read. In my experience, this is possible but highly tricky to do, especially when converting complex XPath statements to CSSSelect ones.
* __The networks could be first built as bill-sponsor bipartite graphs__, and then collapsed to one-mode cosponsorship networks. This would require using [sparse matrixes](http://solomonmessing.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/working-with-bipartiteaffiliation-network-data-in-r/) and only slightly different visualization code. The bills, however, have very little attributes of their own, because very few chambers provide legislative keywords and/or outcome information.
* __The code could be greatly accelerated by switching to Python scraper and SQL databases__, although that would obviously require starting again from scratch. Similarly, adjacency matrixes are probably faster than edge lists as network constructors, but are less practical for inspection and debugging purposes.

# LIMITATIONS

1. __There is no self-updating mechanism: the data has to be refreshed manually__, because self-updating the code would probably require recoding all scrapers in Python so that they might be run periodically through [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com/). It would improve data collection for ongoing legislatures only, and would still require manual updates after website upgrades.
* __Network errors in the download loops require to rerun some of the scripts:__ rerunning the `data.r` scripts two or three times is therefore highly recommended. Some (but not all) scripts contain exception lists to skip over the little amount of errors that might have occurred, but some errors are permanent HTTP 404's and cannot be solved.
* __Some variables are based on manual or semi-manual imputations:__ the `sex` variable is often based on imputation from first names, family names, or both; and the `party` variable is often based on manual recodings or on the "longest affiliation throughout legislature" rule. These limitations are fully documented in the `README` files of each repository.
* __Some variables have many missing or unstandardised values:__ this issue affects the `born` variable, which occasionally has high missing counts in upper houses and is completely missing in [Hungary](https://github.com/briatte/orszaggyules); the `constituency` variable, which is for instance missing in pre-redistricted [Sweden](https://github.com/briatte/riksdag); and the `committee` variable, which cannot be perfectly standardised across countries because of differing parliamentary practices in committee formation.
